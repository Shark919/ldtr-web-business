abstract: Eine lebenslange Liebesgeschichte, die niemals verblasst, dich unglücklich
  macht oder dich enttäuscht - das ist wohl etwas was wir uns alle in irgendeiner
  Form wünschen. Dafür brauchen wir natürlich erstmal jemanden. Einen andere Person,
  die uns genau das geben kann.

### **Social distancing instead of romantic love stories**

A lifelong love story that never fades, never makes you unhappy, or disappoints you - that's probably something we all want in some form or another. For that, of course, we need someone first. Another person who can give us just that. Especially now in the time of social distancing, contact restrictions, and lockdown it is even more difficult than usual to get to know this one person. But why do we try to find that in another person before we have begun to build that love relationship with ourselves?

##### **Love yourself unconditionally and you give the world permission to love you just as you are**

If you're like me a few years ago, every time you hear self-love sayings like this, the following "but's" pop into your head: Yes, okay, then I love myself. But... unconditionally? So being lovable without doing anything for it? Being enough without the perfect body weight? Being proud of myself even if I haven't reached the next career level yet? In a society obsessed with perfection, such statements are difficult for us to accept. No wonder, because we live in a meritocracy in which all areas of life seem to be about faster, higher, and basically always about "more." **And yet we feel that this thinking makes us unhappy.** That we somehow always seem to run after recognition and love, instead of accepting ourselves 100% at this moment, loving ourselves as we are. With all corners and edges.

### **Your perfect love story starts now**

Can you say of yourself that you love yourself without conditions? That is, exactly as you are right now in this moment? Corona and quarantine force us to know if we are happy with ourselves. Whether we are enjoying our time with ourselves. If you're not sure, take the **self-love test**: _stand in front of the mirror for a few minutes, look deep into your eyes, and then say out loud to yourself, "I love you, \[your name\]."_ How does that make you feel? If you feel resistance, if it was difficult to confess love to your Self, or if you couldn't even get the phrase past your lips - please don't feel bad! Take it as a wonderful chance to decide now that you **deserve to** love yourself. Just for you, I've written this article to give you 5 self-love tips to take into your everyday life that will get your most beautiful love story started now.

## **Five practical tips that work to boost your self-love**

Many people want change in their lives, but are not yet ready to do their inner work for it - because many do not even know exactly HOW. Therefore, I'm not about giving you self-love tips that you read once and then think "Yeah, I should probably try that" - only to not do it. **I'm motivating you to practice self-love, to experience it, and to make it such an essential part of your life - that you can't** even imagine not looking at yourself radiantly in the mirror or not creating the life you deserve.

**Because that's what self-love is your foundation for** - following your heart, believing in yourself and your desires, and giving the world permission to see you in your most radiant light. Then you will no longer chase love and success and always have the fear of losing everything - you will know deep in your heart that you deserve all that you desire. That you are worth it.

This article is for you. To help you strengthen your relationship with yourself so that you can experience more love, joy, and peace in your life. I hope from the bottom of my heart that the following words will encourage you to recognize your self-worth, build love for yourself and allow you to follow your heart. **Everything starts with you**. You are enough and you are worthy to have all the happiness you dream of and that awaits you from now on.

### **1 Discover your true self**

In order to love your Self, it is important to learn who exactly you are. Far too often, we unfiltered adopt beliefs, values, life plans, and assumptions from others - without checking whether all this leads us to a happy life according to _our own_ ideas.

#### **Your self-knowledge questions:**

* What does self-love mean to me?
* In which moments do I have the feeling of taking really good care of myself? To stand up for me and do something good for me?
* What does a perfect morning/day/evening look like for me?
* In which moments do I feel really happy?
* What qualities do I admire in other people?
* What does my inner critic tell me when I make a "mistake"?
* What takes a lot of my energy?

Take a piece of paper, your diary, or a notebook and write down your answers to these questions. Take your time, feel inside yourself and look behind all the preconceptions from your environment. **You can be really proud of yourself for being brave enough to just take a closer look - you're doing fantastic!**

### **2 Install your inner cheerleader**

Far too often we allow our Inner Critic to badmouth us for every little thing that doesn't go as planned. In fact, we can't really please him, can we? Now think about how you treat your best friend - especially when they are not perfect. We bring up love and understanding, and that's exactly how you should treat yourself from now on! **The most important words you will ever hear are the words you say to yourself.** So from now on, talk to yourself as if you were your biggest fan! When you get a compliment from someone, your mind can always interject, 'Yeah, that's nice, but the compliment is only because she wants to be in your circle of friends anyway.' Or because she wants to hear the same thing from me.' But when you compliment yourself, your mind has no choice but to believe you. **So shower yourself with compliments!** Stand in front of the mirror, look yourself in the eye and say all the wonderful words you wish your partner, your parents or your girlfriend would say to you. The crazier you feel about it, the more effective it is and in the long run, it changes your entire relationship with yourself.

If your inner cheerleader is having a hard time finding loving, encouraging, and positive words at first, affirmations are a great support. Next week I'll be publishing a **new blog article** where you'll get wonderful self-love affirmations from me and learn what the magic behind affirmations is!

### **3 Find your language of love**

When it comes to our expression of love, it is important to realize that we do not all have the same mother tongue. In order to give yourself the love you need, the first step is to learn what language of love you speak.

If your love language is _praise and appreciation_ or _gifts_ mean a lot to you, be sure to delight yourself with loving words or rewards at every small and big achievement. That postcard with the sweet saying that made you smile? Get it and hang it on your wall! Those stylish shoes you saw? Treat yourself to them!

If your love language is _togetherness_, set regular date-with-myself days that are all about doing things that make you happy - a bubble bath, your favorite game, watching your feel-good series for hours on end, or walking alone in nature? Do it!

If your language of love is _helpfulness_, be sure to ask yourself the question: What good can I do for me? What do I need support with? Learn to actively ask for and accept help from friends and family. You will notice how your self-love simply increases when you stand up for yourself and your needs and realize how gladly others are there for you!

The fifth language of love is _tenderness_ - and is a wonderful expression of self-love. Put on lots of creams, go for a massage, treat yourself to a face mask and enjoy feeling yourself - because we ourselves still know best which touches feel fantastic to us.

You don't know your love language? <a href="https://www.5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can take the test!

### **4 Forgive yourself**

> **_"Letting go is the key to happiness." - Buddha_**

We all carry old wounds, old beliefs, and habits from our past. These have arisen because we have attributed a certain meaning to experiences, encounters, and experiences. We have made decisions about ourselves, about others, and about the world. The question is - How do your past choices serve you now at this moment? What does it really do for you to not forgive yourself or others? Your past does not define your present, not your future - not who you are. In fact, the only thing that keeps us holding on to our old wounds is our minds. It tries to keep us safe, to protect us from hurt, to keep us alive - its job is not to make us happy. **That is your job!**

Make yourself happy by loving yourself. True self-love means accepting yourself, forgiving yourself, and not allowing yourself to relive the pain of the past over and over again by holding on to negative emotions. If your history is not helping you feel free and at your best, then there is no reason to hold on to the past. Because you deserve to be happy - you get to forgive yourself _right now_ in this moment.

**The more understanding you have for yourself, the more loving you will be with yourself.** Only if we manage to accept ourselves as we are - with everything that belongs to it - we will make peace with ourselves and finally experience more self-love. Are you ready? Let's go!

* **_Step 1: Accept what is..._**  
  ... because the only real thing is your Here and Now. This moment in which you read these words. Everything else happens only in your head. Acceptance and surrender to what is not only gives you back your inner peace but also allows you to finally give up your resistance - against what was, against what is, against yourself and the world.
* **_Step 2: Change your conclusions_**  
  You cannot change the past. That feels very final at first. But I have a surprise for you - you don't need to be free of it! Often we think that something happened that way and therefore we can't feel any different. In fact, the only thing that matters is what conclusions you have made about yourself and the world based on your experience. So change your perspective on the situation and yourself so that you can make new conclusions! To do this, you can ask yourself the following questions:
  * _What three things have come out of this past situation as a positive result?_
  * _What did I learn for my life from the situation or thanks to this weakness of mine?_
  * _What did the situation or this weakness of mine protect me from?_

Write down the answers and be prepared that your mind wants you to believe that there is nothing positive there. Keep at it, change your perspective - you'll find something, you're doing fantastic!

* **_Step 3: Allow help_**

Self-coaching is a great thing. There are countless tools, books, and possibilities with which we can help ourselves, solve problems, and always develop further. But there are also situations in which you ask yourself how many guides and tips you still have to read so that nothing changes in your life. If you think, "Some of the tips sound great.... But I can't do it. None of it works for me." Or you've noticed while reading that you're actually criticizing yourself all the time. That you rarely feel lighthearted and you feel your life is more of a burden, then **now is** the time to get the support you deserve!

With your decision to allow help, you have just taken the first step towards your healing. **Congratulations!** From here on, you don't have to go it alone - schedule your free consultation with me right <a href="https://innerlight-hypnotherapy.com/en/book-call" target="_blank">here</a> and together we'll figure out how to create the life reality you dream of.

You are not alone on your path - _I see you, I see your potential and I am there for you so that you can let your inner light shine again._ Learn more about me and how I can support you!

### **5 Take a new job - start your inner work!**

How much time do you spend every day working for a company or doing something for someone else? And how much time do you spend doing something for _your_ inner happiness, for _your_ inner lightness, _your inner_ peace? If you compare both and realize that the extra weight is not on your self-love side, now is the time to change that. **You and your happiness are your #1 job** - because no one else can do that job for you. It's about your willingness to do your inner work.

It is _your_ decision to make YOU your top priority from now on and to bring self-love into your life. Because when you start to love yourself, you will notice **how suddenly your whole life changes**. Suddenly you care more and more about yourself, you start to notice and communicate your boundaries. You respect your needs and suddenly listen more and more to your heart and your inner voice.

**When you love yourself, your happiness, health, and fulfillment are paramount to you - and you realize that without self-love, you will never be able to truly love others.**

### **Change your beliefs and you change your life**

If we really want to change something, it is necessary to change what we do every day. It's about giving up the way you _used to be_ so that your _TRUE self_ can shine. But how do you get away from your habitual and towards your true self?

Your beliefs determine your behavior, your behavior determines your experiences. For example, you have the belief 'I am not enough'. Your behavior is that you try to achieve more, to be more, to have more, and to live up to others, to get the confirmation that - _if only you did enough - you_ are finally enough. Your experience is that you will always find evidence that your basic belief is correct - that you are not enough. That's just the way our minds work. That's why we keep finding ourselves in toxic relationships, jobs that make us unhappy, or other situations that confirm exactly what we subconsciously believe to be true. Namely that we are not enough.

It's time to break this vicious circle - and make it your **circle of light**! A circle of light leads to the fact that you can let your inner light shine more and more. Your negative beliefs are deeply embedded in your subconscious mind and can be most quickly and successfully replaced with positive, life-affirming beliefs using <a href="https://innerlight-hypnotherapy.com/en/rtt/" target="_blank">Rapid Transformational Therapy™</a>. **YOU are enough - just the way you are right now.** With all the rough edges. And after just one to three sessions, you won't be able to imagine ever thinking or feeling anything else.

### **Make self-love your daily routine**

If we really want to change something in our lives, we have to change what we do every day. The key is **your golden self-love routine**! To help you integrate your newfound self-love into your everyday life, I've created a powerful visualization poster for you. All the insights you gathered while answering the self-knowledge question will go on your self-love poster:

* **Step 1:** Download and print your visualization poster: <a href="self-love-poster.pdf" download="self-love-poster.pdf"> Self-Love Poster </a>.  
  Or you can let your creativity run wild and create your own poster!
* **Step 2:** Everything positive you wrote down when answering the self-knowledge question goes on your poster! Write down everything you need to be truly happy and everything you can do to make yourself feel good.
* **Step 3:** Hang your golden self-love routine somewhere you'll always see it or fold it up and put it in the back of your phone case. Either way, **remind yourself as often as you can that you deserve to love yourself, that you are worth it, and how you can give yourself that self-love in your everyday life!**

#### **Are you ready for it?**

Are you ready to take responsibility for giving yourself the love and attention you deserve? To stop letting others fill your love tank? To reclaim your power over your happiness and no longer make it dependent on external circumstances and the reactions of others?

When you love yourself, you give the world permission to love you, to see you as you are. You are wanted, you are loved, you are needed - time to let your inner light shine. Time to make your happiness your top priority. Time to invest in yourself and your best life. Decide now for yourself and your happiness. I look forward to seeing you and thank you for your trust - in me and in you.

_Namasté ♥_
