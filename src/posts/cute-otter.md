  title: How otters are simply the cutest animals on this planet.
  content: |-
    Two and a half months ago at the start of the global pandemic we had a really hard decision to make, where do we go? For most people the answer is simple, 'home'. But for us it's kind of complicated. We've been travelling the world non stop for 4 years and although we have an apartment in Kuala Lumpur, home for us is still to be decided.

    Because of the seriousness of the situation we were forced to ask ourselves the question "where do we feel the most at home?” and the answer was clear - Bali.

    We have been here for 3 months now and we couldn’t be happier about our decision. Although there have been a lot of changes on the island, we love this place and we love how the locals and foreigners combined have handled the difficult situation we all find ourselves in.

    How has Bali faired compared to the rest of the world? Has this peaceful island turned into chaos? We know that a lot of you had to cancel your travel plans to come here and are probably wondering when you might be able to return.

    So in this post, we want to share our observations with you of how life here in Bali has changed and give you information direct from the authorities.
